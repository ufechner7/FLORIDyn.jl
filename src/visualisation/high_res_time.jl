"""
    unique_name()::String

Creates a unique directory name for storing simulation results.

This function generates a unique directory name by combining the prefix "floridyn_run_"
with a high-resolution timestamp. The timestamp includes microsecond precision to ensure
uniqueness even when multiple simulations are started in quick succession.

# Returns
- `String`: A unique directory name in the format `"floridyn_run_YYYY-mm-ddTHH-MM-SS.uuuuuu"`

# Examples
```julia
julia> unique_name()
"floridyn_run_2025-08-08T16-58-55.494911"

julia> unique_name()
"floridyn_run_2025-08-08T16-58-55.495123"
```

# Notes
- The generated name is suitable for use as a directory name on all operating systems
- Uses hyphens instead of colons in the time portion for filesystem compatibility
- Microsecond precision ensures uniqueness for rapid successive calls
- Used to create separate output directories for each run

# See Also

- [`Vis`](@ref): Visualization settings that may use unique names for output directories
"""

"""
    delete_results(vis::Vis, n::Int=1; dry_run::Bool = false)

Delete the newest `n` directories starting with "floridyn_run" from both the visualization 
output directory and video directory.

This function provides comprehensive cleanup by removing the most recent floridyn_run directories
from both output and video paths simultaneously. It's particularly useful for removing failed runs, 
test runs, or managing disk space by keeping only the most relevant simulation outputs across
both directory types.

# Arguments
- `vis::Vis`: Visualization settings object containing both output and video path configurations
- `n::Int`: Number of newest directories to delete from each directory (must be positive, default: 1)  
- `dry_run::Bool`: Preview mode - shows what would be deleted without actually deleting (default: `false`)

# Returns
- `Vector{String}`: Absolute paths of directories that were deleted from both locations combined.
  Returns empty vector if no matching directories found or if `n â‰¤ 0`.

# Behavior
- **Directory Search**: Searches both `vis.output_path` and `vis.video_path` for directories matching `floridyn_run_*` pattern
- **Dual Cleanup**: Operates on both output and video directories in sequence
- **Sorting**: Sorts directories by modification time (newest first) within each directory
- **Selection**: Selects up to `n` newest directories for deletion from each location
- **Cleanup**: Automatically sets `vis.unique_folder = ""` before processing
- **Dry Run**: When `dry_run=true`, logs what would be deleted but performs no actual deletion

# Examples
```julia
# Create visualization settings
vis = Vis("data/vis_default.yaml")

# Delete the single newest floridyn_run directory from both output and video directories
deleted = delete_results(vis)
println("Deleted: ", length(deleted), " directories total")

# Delete the 3 newest floridyn_run directories from each location
deleted = delete_results(vis, 3)
println("Deleted directories: ", basename.(deleted))

# Preview what would be deleted from both directories
delete_results(vis, 5, dry_run=true)  # Shows info about 5 newest in each directory

# Check existing directories in both locations
vis.unique_folder = ""  
output_runs = find_floridyn_runs(vis.output_path)
video_runs = find_floridyn_runs(vis.video_path)
println("Found \$(length(output_runs)) in output, \$(length(video_runs)) in video")
```

# Error Handling
- **Invalid Input**: Warns and returns empty vector for non-positive `n`
- **Missing Directories**: Errors if either `vis.output_path` or `vis.video_path` doesn't exist
- **No Matches**: Info message and early return if no floridyn_run directories found in either location
- **Deletion Failures**: Individual directory deletion errors are logged but don't stop the process

# Important Notes
- **Dual Operation**: This function operates on BOTH output and video directories
- **Independent Processing**: Each directory is processed separately - `n` directories from output AND `n` directories from video
- **Early Return**: Function returns early if no directories are found in the first location checked
- **Path Creation**: Accessing `vis.output_path` and `vis.video_path` automatically creates these directories if they don't exist
