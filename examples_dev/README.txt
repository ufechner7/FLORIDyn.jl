The folder examples_dev contains minimal working examples and is not intended for users, but only for developers.

It provides short code snippets that:
- either provide a working example of a package, a function or a feature
- or provide a piece of code that demonstrates a bug

New developers/ students who want to contribute to this project should study and try
to understand them. Ask in the chat about them.

They can be deleted if they are undocumented and stale (not updated in the last week).
