# Simulation settings
## Introduction
The settings are defined in five `.yaml` files in the folder `data`, one to define the simulation and one to define the visualization. In addition, there is a `projects.yaml` and a `default.yaml` file  The function [`setup`](@ref) converts the first one into three settings structs, containing strings and numbers. The constructor [`Settings`](@ref) creates a struct of marker types from these settings structs. 

For each of the simulation yaml files there must be a folder with the same name (without the `.yaml` extension) in the data directory. In this folder the required `.csv` files must be stored.

The constructor `Vis(filename)` creates a visualisation settings struct from the visualisation yaml file. The file `turbine_specs.yaml` contains the turbine
definitions.

A project has a name and a description  and consists of the two `yaml` files mentioned above. The `default.yaml` file is autogenerated and must NOT be in git. It stores the name of the active project
and the name of the default measurement.

## The file 2021\_9T\_Data.yaml
This is the main input configuration file.

wind:
  # Velocity Input
  # - I_and_I       uses the Immersion and Invariance effective wind speed estimator based on SOWFA data. 
  # - Interpolation linearly interpolates between set-points, the value is equally used for all turbines.
  # - Interpolation_wErrorCov Same as above, but with error covariance. 
  # - InterpTurbine also linearly interpolates between set-points, but individually for every turbine. 
  # - InterpTurbine_wErrorCov Same as above, but with error covariance.
  # - Constant      provides a constant velocity for all turbines.
  # - Constant_wErrorCov      Same as above, but with error covariance.
  # - EnKF_InterpTurbine
  # - RW_with_Mean  random walk with mean
  # - ZOH_wErrorCov

  # The discretization method, 'sunflower' or 'isocell'. The latter provides a regular grid 
  # with equal sized cells. This is the favoured method! Downside is that the number of cells
  # can not be chosen freely, the algorithm might correct the requested number of cells to 
  # the nearest possible number (3, 12, 27, 48, 75, 108, 147, ...).  
  # Sunflower distributes based on an outgoing spiral, the number of cells can be freely chosen.

    # Operating point (OP) / wind field propagation

    #            This smoothes out turbulent inputs and reduces the occasions when one OP overtakes another OP. 
    # 'Maximum'  overwrites the state of a slower OP once the faster one overtakes it.

# Controller
# Currently only the yaw angle can be set, the axial induction factor is always set to 1/3.
# - 'Interpolate' per turbine reads an orientation file 'Control_YawInterpolation.csv' 
#                 to interpolate the turbines world orientation between different set-points. 
# - SOWFA         reads the file 'SOWFA_nacelleYaw.csv' which is directly the renamed file
#                 from a SOWFA simulation. 
# - Constant      reads a single orientation and applies it to all turbines at all times.
