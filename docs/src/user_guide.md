# User guide

This page contains information for developers who want to contribute to or extend FLORIDyn.jl.

## Installation
Currently, installation using git is recommended. Later this year installation as Julia package will
be better tested. This requires the issue [Create a package extension for plotting](https://github.com/ufechner7/FLORIDyn.jl/issues/39)
to be resolved.
