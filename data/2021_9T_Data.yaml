  # Velocity Input
  # - I_and_I       uses the Immersion and Invariance effective wind speed estimator based on SOWFA data. 
  # - Interpolation linearly interpolates between set-points, the value is equally used for all turbines.
  # - Interpolation_wErrorCov Same as above, but with error covariance. 
  # - InterpTurbine also linearly interpolates between set-points, but individually for every turbine. 
  # - InterpTurbine_wErrorCov Same as above, but with error covariance.
  # - Constant      provides a constant velocity for all turbines.
  # - Constant_wErrorCov      Same as above, but with error covariance.
  # - EnKF_InterpTurbine

  # Wind Shear Input
  #   For the custom wind profile the reduction is interpolated between given set-points, this option 
  #   is called Interpolate and expects input normalized by hub-height and wind speed at hub-height.
  # - PowerLaw
  # - Interpolate

  # State Correction
  #   Choose how flow metrics are corrected in the simulation based on measurements of the turbines or 
  #   of the states in the OPs.
  #   The option Influence makes turbines in the wake of other turbines copy the state of the OPs of the 
  #   upstream turbines. Uninfluenced turbines will use the flow measures as provided by the selected input method. 
  #   With the option None the values from the inputs are put into the OPs and existing OPs keep their unaltered state.

    # Option for velocity correction
    # - None
    # - Influence
    vel: None
    # Option for wind direction correction
    #   For the wind direction All is also an option, meaning that all OPs will be assigned the same wind direction. 
    #   The value is based on the first returned value of the wind direction input.

  # The discretization method, 'sunflower' or 'isocell'. The latter provides a regular grid

  # the nearest possible number (3, 12, 27, 48, 75, 108, 147, ...).

# Controller
# Currently only the yaw angle can be set, the axial induction factor is always set to 1/3.
# - 'Interpolate' per turbine reads an orientation file 'Control_YawInterpolation.csv' 
#                 to interpolate the turbines world orientation between different set-points. 
# - SOWFA         reads the file 'SOWFA_nacelleYaw.csv' which is directly the renamed file
#                 from a SOWFA simulation. 
# - Constant      reads a single orientation and applies it to all turbines at all times.
