  # Velocity Input
  # - I_and_I       uses the Immersion and Invariance effective wind speed estimator based on SOWFA data. 
  # - Interpolation linearly interpolates between set-points, the value is equally used for all turbines.
  # - Interpolation_wErrorCov Same as above, but with error covariance. 
  # - InterpTurbine also linearly interpolates between set-points, but individually for every turbine. 
  # - InterpTurbine_wErrorCov Same as above, but with error covariance.
  # - Constant      provides a constant velocity for all turbines.
  # - Constant_wErrorCov
  # - EnKF_InterpTurbine

# Currently only the yaw angle can be set, the axial induction factor is always set to 1/3.
# - 'Interpolate' per turbine reads an orientation file 'Control_YawInterpolation.csv' 
#                 to interpolate the turbines world orientation between different set-points. 
# - SOWFA         reads the file 'SOWFA_nacelleYaw.csv' which is directly the renamed file
#                 from a SOWFA simulation. 
# - Constant      reads a single orientation and applies it to all turbines at all times.
